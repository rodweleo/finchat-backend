# Hedera Agent Kit Tools

## HBAR
### `transfer_hbar(client, toAccountId, amount)`

This asynchronous function facilitates the transfer of HBAR from the operator account (associated with the provided Hedera `client`) to a specified recipient account.

---

#### Parameters

- **client**: `Client`  
  An instance of the Hedera SDK client that holds the operator account used for initiating the transfer.

- **toAccountId**: `string | AccountId`  
  The target account to which HBAR will be transferred. This can be provided either as a string or as an `AccountId` object.

- **amount**: `string`  
  The amount of HBAR to be transferred. This value is used to debit the operator’s account and credit the recipient’s account. 

---

#### Returns

- **Promise<TransferHBARResult>**  
  A promise that resolves to an object containing:
    - **status**: `string` — The status of the transaction receipt.
    - **txHash**: `string` — The transaction hash (transaction ID) of the executed transfer.

---

#### Behavior & Error Handling

1. **Operator Account Check**:  
   The function first retrieves the operator account ID from the client. If the operator account is not defined, it throws an error with the message `"Invalid operator accountId in client"`.

2. **Transaction Construction**:  
   It creates a `TransferTransaction` that:
    - Debits the operator’s account by the specified amount.
    - Credits the target account by the same amount.

3. **Transaction Execution & Receipt**:  
   The transaction is executed on the network. The function then obtains the receipt and checks the transaction status.

4. **Error on Failure**:  
   If the transaction receipt’s status does not include `"SUCCESS"`, the function throws an error indicating the transfer has failed.

    - The submit key to the operator's public key if `isSubmitKey` is `true`.

2. **Transaction Execution & Receipt**:  
   The transaction is executed on the network, and the function retrieves its receipt to determine the outcome.

3. **Error Handling**:
    - If the receipt's status does not indicate `"SUCCESS"`, the function throws an error with the message `"Topic creation transaction failed"`.
    - If the receipt does not include a `topicId`, it throws an error with the message `"Unknown error occurred during topic creation."`

## Account - Account management

### `approve_asset_allowance(spenderAccount, tokenId, amount, client)`

This asynchronous function approves a specified allowance for an account (spender) to either spend HBAR or a specific token, depending on whether a `tokenId` is provided. The function uses the provided Hedera `client` to execute the approval transaction.

---

#### Parameters

- **spenderAccount**: `AccountId`  
  The account ID of the spender, which will be granted the allowance to transfer the specified amount.

- **tokenId**: `TokenId | undefined`  
  The ID of the token for which the allowance is being granted. If this parameter is `undefined`, the allowance is for HBAR.

- **amount**: `number`  
  The amount of the asset (either HBAR or the specified token) to be approved for spending by the `spenderAccount`.

- **client**: `Client`  
  An instance of the Hedera SDK client that holds the operator account used to authorize the allowance.

#### Returns

- **Promise<AssetAllowanceResult>**  
  A promise that resolves to an object containing:
    - **status**: `string` — The status of the transaction receipt (e.g., `"SUCCESS"`).
    - **txHash**: `string` — The transaction hash (transaction ID) of the approval transaction.

---

#### Behavior & Error Handling

1. **Allowance Type Determination**:  
   The function first checks whether a `tokenId` is provided:
    - If `tokenId` is defined, it creates a token allowance approval for the specified token.
    - If `tokenId` is `undefined`, it defaults to approving an HBAR allowance.

2. **Transaction Creation & Execution**:  
   The appropriate `AccountAllowanceApproveTransaction` is constructed:
    - For token allowance, the transaction approves the specified amount of the token to be spent by the spender.
    - For HBAR allowance, the transaction approves the specified amount of HBAR to be spent by the spender.  
      The transaction is then frozen and executed.

3. **Receipt Retrieval & Status Check**:  
   After executing the transaction, the function retrieves the transaction receipt and verifies its status to determine if the approval was successful.

4. **Error Handling**:  
   If the transaction receipt's status does not include `"SUCCESS"`, the function will throw an error, indicating that the approval has failed.
